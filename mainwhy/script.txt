for many of us, our first python program looked like this


(* with my mypy1,py on screen *)
However after your first 5 minutes with python you should use this
Why?

(* mypy2.py on screen cut out testing code *) Say we make a cool function
(* paste testing code back in) and we want to test it
(* run mypy2.py *) Cool, it works!
(* put mypy3.py on screen *) Now we want to bring it into another module
(* run mypy3.py *) it works, but our testing code runs too :(

you see when you run a python program, the file specified on the command line becomes the __main__ module

by putting the if __name__ == '__main__' you're saying don't run this code unless we're the main.

This way you get to keep your testing code and can freely import it into other modules
